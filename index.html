                HERD hosts a quarterly public event featuring amateur storytelling performances. An optional pre-event
                workshop is offered to help storytellers refine their stories. The event is inspired by StorySlams like
                NPR’s The Moth, but with a women-centered, empowerment focus. There will be no judging or winners;
                instead, selected audience members will provide real-time supportive feedback to the storytellers. Come
                to a HERD event to listen, learn, share, laugh, weep, bond, and connect!

                We chose HERD because it encompasses HER- we want to be a space for anyone who
                has walked through this male-dominated/focused world and not felt entirely welcomed, who have found
                themselves
                ‘outside’ the norm, who have looked for a ‘room of their own.’ HERD also reminds us that what
                happens to one of us impacts all of us.

                <img src="1.png" alt="Herd  1" class="inline-image right">

                <br /><br />
                We chose the word HERD because it’s a homophone of HEARD. And that’s our number one objective- to
                help you be heard. Your stories matter. They will change the world.

                <br /><br />

                We chose the word HERD because it embodies the collective identity- the belonging to a group, the
                feeling of a sisterhood that is expansive and limitless, but also right here, in the room.
                <img src="2.png" alt="Herd  2" class="inline-image right">

                <br /><br />
                We know there are negative connotations to herds. Herd mentality isn’t always a good thing.
                And being called a sheep- that most common of herd animals, can be synonymous for following blindly. And
                then there’s cows. You old cow. But we aim to turn that all on its head. There is power in a herd.
                And in the animal kingdom- herds are primarily female.

                <br /><br />
                <img src="3.png" alt="Herd  3" class="inline-image left">

                Did you know that a herd of musk ox, when feeling threatened, rush together to form a protective
                circle, facing outward, forming a phalanx of heads and horns? It kind of feels like that is what
                might be needed right now. A phalanx of heads and horns.

                <br /><br />
                So let’s build our herd! We believe that by sharing your story with other women, by being vulnerable
                and sharing your mistakes as well as your triumphs, you will inspire others to get out there and
                give it a go. You will make this world stronger, and safer, and frankly more delightful. Get ready
                to join the herd. Be HERD. You Are Herd.
