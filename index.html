                    workshop is offered to help storytellers refine their stories. The event is inspired by StorySlams
                    like
                    NPR's The Moth, but with a women-centered, empowerment focus. There will be no judging or winners;
                    instead, selected audience members will provide real-time supportive feedback to the storytellers.
                    Come
                    to a HERD event to listen, learn, share, laugh, weep, bond, and connect!

                            patriarchy. Recount a moment when your perspective was jolted into a new reality, or a time

                    We chose HERD because it encompasses HER- we want to be a space for anyone who
                    has walked through this male-dominated/focused world and not felt entirely welcomed, who have found
                    themselves 'outside' the norm, who have looked for a 'room of their own.' HERD also reminds us that
                    what
                    happens to one of us impacts all of us.

                    <br /> <br />

                    We chose the word HERD because it's a homophone of HEARD. And that's our number one objective- to
                    help you be heard. Your stories matter. They will change the world.

                    <img src="content/1.png" alt="Women sharing stories" class="circle-image left">
                    <br /> <br />
                    We chose the word HERD because it embodies the collective identity- the belonging to a group, the
                    feeling of a sisterhood that is expansive and limitless, but also right here, in the room.
                    <br /> <br />

                    We know there are negative connotations to herds. Herd mentality isn't always a good thing.
                    And being called a sheep- that most common of herd animals, can be synonymous for following blindly.
                    And then there's cows. You old cow. But we aim to turn that all on its head. There is power in a
                    herd. And in the animal kingdom- herds are primarily female.
                    <br /> <br />

                    Did you know that a herd of musk ox, when feeling threatened, rush together to form a protective
                    circle, facing outward, forming a phalanx of heads and horns? It kind of feels like that is what
                    might be needed right now. A phalanx of heads and horns.
                    <br /> <br />
                    So let's build our herd! We believe that by sharing your story with other women, by being vulnerable
                    and sharing your mistakes as well as your triumphs, you will inspire others to get out there and
                    give it a go. You will make this world stronger, and safer, and frankly more delightful. Get ready
                    to join the herd. Be HERD. You Are Herd.

                    Amy and Gretchen met working as summer staff at YMCA Camp St. Croix in the late 1980s and have been
                    lifelong friends. At a time when big hair and even bigger glasses were in style and girls were often
                    taught that "no" meant "yes," they found camp to be a refuge. It was a place where young women could
                    create their own path, rather than conform to societal expectations. They were free to be themselves
                    —
                    loud, funny, strong, brash, and daring. They led rowdy songs in the dining hall, made no apologies
                    for
                    winning a challenge, pushed their cabin groups to set high goals and expectations for themselves,
                    and
                    regularly challenged the notion of a "four-man tent." It just felt fun at the time, but it turns out
                    they were also mentoring and empowering scores of girls; encouraging them to embrace their authentic
                    selves.
                    <br /><br />

                    As Gretchen and Amy entered their fifties, they got the itch. What if there was a way to continue to
                    help women find their voice? Was it time to take a role as an elder and bring the herd together for
                    safety, strength, and community? We think so! Let's do this.
