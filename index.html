                    We chose HERD because it encompasses HER— we want to be a space for anyone who
                    has walked through this male-dominated/focused world and not felt entirely welcomed, who has found
                    themselves <span class="text-highlight">'outside' the norm</span>, who has looked for a 'room of
                    their own.' HERD also reminds us that
                    what happens to one of us impacts all of us.
                    <br /><br />
                    We chose the word HERD because it's a homophone of HEARD. And that's
                    our number one objective— <span class="text-highlight">to
                        help you be heard</span>. Your stories matter. They will change the world.
                    <br /><br />
                    We chose the word HERD because it embodies the collective identity- the
                    belonging to a group, the feeling of a sisterhood that is <span class="text-highlight">expansive and
                        limitless</span>,
                    but also right here, in the room.

                    <br /><br />
                    We know there are negative connotations to herds. Herd mentality isn't always a good thing.
                    And being called a sheep- that most common of herd animals, can be synonymous for following blindly.
                    And then there's cows. You old cow. But we aim to turn that all on its
                    head. <span class="text-highlight">There is power in a herd</span>. And in the animal kingdom- herds
                    are primarily female.
                    <br /><br />

                    Did you know that a herd of musk ox, when feeling threatened, rush together to form a protective
                    circle, facing outward, forming a phalanx of heads and horns? It kind of feels like that
                    is what might be needed right now. <span class="text-highlight">A phalanx of heads and horns.</span>

                    <br /><br />
                    So let's build our herd! We believe that by sharing your story with other women, by being vulnerable
                    and sharing your mistakes as well as your triumphs, <span class="text-highlight">you will inspire
                        others to get out there and
                        give it a go</span>. You will make this world stronger, and safer, and frankly more delightful.
                    Get ready
                    to join the herd. Be HERD. You Are Herd.

                    Amy and Gretchen met working as summer staff at YMCA Camp St.
                    Croix in the late 1980s and have been
                    lifelong friends. At a time when big hair and even bigger glasses were in style and girls were often
                    taught that "no" meant "yes," they found camp to be a refuge. It was a place where young women could
                    create their own path, rather than conform to societal expectations.
                    They were free to be themselves—
                    loud, funny, strong, brash, and daring. They led rowdy songs in the dining hall, made no apologies
                    for
                    winning a challenge, pushed their cabin groups to set high goals and expectations for themselves,
                    and
                    regularly challenged the notion of a "four-man tent." It just felt fun at the time, but it turns out
                    they were also mentoring and empowering scores of girls; encouraging them to embrace their authentic
                    selves.

                    As Gretchen and Amy entered their fifties, they got the itch. What if there was a way to continue to
                    help women find their voice? Was it time to take a role as an elder and bring the herd
                    together for
                    safety, strength, and community? We think so! Let's do this.
