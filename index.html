                    We chose HERD because it encompasses HER- we want to be a space for anyone who
                    has walked through this male-dominated/focused world and not felt entirely welcomed, who have found
                    themselves <span class="text-highlight">'outside' the norm</span>, who have looked for a 'room of
                    their own.' HERD also reminds us that
                    what happens to one of us impacts all of us.

                <p class="section-text">
                    We chose the word HERD because it's a homophone of HEARD. And that's
                    our number one objective- <span class="text-highlight">to
                        help you be heard</span>. Your stories matter. They will change the world.

                <p class="section-text">
                    We chose the word HERD because it embodies the collective identity- the
                    belonging to a group, the
                    feeling of a sisterhood that is <span class="text-highlight">expansive and limitless</span>,
                    but also right here, in the

                <p class="section-text">
                    We know there are negative connotations to herds. Herd mentality isn't always a good thing.
                    And being called a sheep- that most common of herd animals, can be synonymous for following blindly.
                    And then there's cows. You old cow. But we aim to turn that all on its
                    head. <span class="text-highlight">There is power in a
                        herd</span>. And in the animal kingdom- herds are primarily female.

                    Did you know that a herd of musk ox, when feeling threatened, rush together to form a protective

                    is what
                    might be needed right now. <span class="text-highlight">A phalanx of heads and horns.</span>

                <p class="section-text">
                    So let's build our herd! We believe that by sharing your story with other women, by being vulnerable
                    and sharing your mistakes as well as your triumphs, <span class="text-highlight">you will inspire

                    Amy and Gretchen met working as summer staff at YMCA Camp St. Croix in the late 1980s and have been
                    lifelong friends. At a time when big hair and even bigger glasses were in style and girls were often
                    taught that "no" meant "yes," they found camp to be a refuge. It was a place where young women could
                    create their own path, rather than conform to societal expectations.
                    They were free to be themselves
                    —
                    loud, funny, strong, brash, and daring. They led rowdy songs in the dining hall, made no apologies
                    for
                    winning a challenge, pushed their cabin groups to set high goals and expectations for themselves,
                    and
                    regularly challenged the notion of a "four-man tent." It just felt fun at the time, but it turns out
                    they were also mentoring and empowering scores of girls; encouraging them to embrace their authentic
                    selves.

                    <br /><br />

                    As Gretchen and Amy entered their fifties, they got the itch. What if there was a way to continue to
                    help women find their voice? Was it time to take a role as an elder and bring the herd together for
                    safety, strength, and community? We think so! Let's do this.
