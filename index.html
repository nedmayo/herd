                    Prepare a five minute story about the time you crashed the party, the mini van, or the choir risers.
                    Tell us the tale of how you smashed through the glass ceiling or threw a punch at the patriarchy.
                    Recount a moment when your perspective was jolted into a new reality, or a time you ran into a
                    system error and instead of crashing, you found a new way. Let us know about a time you went out

                </div>
                <p>Amy and Gretchen met working as summer staff at YMCA Camp St. Croix in the late 1980s and have been
                    lifelong friends. At a time when big hair and even bigger glasses were in style and girls were often
                    taught that "no" meant "yes," they found camp to be a refuge. It was a place where young women could
                    create their own path, rather than conform to societal expectations. They were free to be themselves
                    — loud, funny, strong, brash, and daring. They led rowdy songs in the dining hall, made no apologies
                    for winning a challenge, pushed their cabin groups to set high goals and expectations for
                    themselves, and regularly challenged the notion of a “four man tent.” It just felt like a lot of fun
                    at the time, but it turns out they were also mentoring and empowering hundreds of girls; encouraging
                    them to embrace their authentic selves.
                    As Gretchen and Amy entered their fifties, they got the itch. What if there was a way to continue to
                    help women find their voice?
                    HERD is going to do that.
                    HERD is the place to find other women who are ready to change how this world works.
                    Why HERD?
                    We chose the word HERD because it encompasses HER- we want to be a space for anyone who has walked
                    through this male-dominated/focused world and not felt entirely welcomed, who have found themselves
                    ‘outside’ the norm, who have looked for a ‘room of their own’. HERD also reminds us that what
                    happens to one of us impacts all of us. We are all her. We are all Gisele Pelicot. We are all….who
                    else? Help.
                    We chose the word HERD because it sounds like HEARD. And that’s our number one objective- help you
                    be heard. Your stories matter. They will change the world.
                    We chose the word HERD because it embodies the collective identity- the belonging to a group, the
                    feeling of a sisterhood that is expansive and limitless, but also right here, in the room.
                    We know there are negative connotations to herds. Herd mentality isn’t always a good thing. And
                    being called a sheep- that most common of herd animals, can be synonymous for following blindly. And
                    then there’s cows. You old cow. But we aim to turn that all on its head. There is power in a herd.
                    And in the animal kingdom- herds are primarily female.
                    Did you know that a herd of musk ox, when feeling threatened, rush together to form a circle, facing
                    outward, forming a phalanx of heads and horns? It kind of feels like that is what might be needed
                    right now. A phalanx of heads and horns.
                    So let’s build our herd! We believe that by sharing your story with other women, by being vulnerable
                    and sharing your mistakes as well as your triumphs, you will inspire others to get out there and
                    give it a go. You will make this world stronger, and safer, and frankly more delightful. Get ready
                    to join the herd. Be herd. You Are Herd.
