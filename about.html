                    <p>We chose HERD because it encompasses HER— we want to be a space for anyone who has walked through
                        this male-dominated/focused world and not felt entirely welcomed, who has found themselves 'outside' the norm, who has looked for a 'room of their own.'
                        HERD also reminds us that what happens to one of us impacts all of us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-block">
                    <p>We chose the word HERD because it's a homophone of HEARD. And that's our number one objective—
                        to help you be heard. Your stories matter. They will change
                        the world.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-block">
                    <p>We chose the word HERD because it embodies the collective identity- the belonging to a group, the
                        feeling of a sisterhood that is expansive and limitless, but
                        also right here, in the room.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-block">
                    <p>We know there are negative connotations to herds. Herd mentality isn't always a good thing. And
                        being called a sheep- that most common of herd animals, can be synonymous for following blindly.
                        And then there's cows. You old cow. But we aim to turn that all on its head. There is power in a herd. And in the animal kingdom- herds are
                        primarily female.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-block">
                    <p>Did you know that a herd of musk ox, when feeling threatened, rush together to form a protective
                        circle, facing outward, forming a phalanx of heads and horns? It kind of feels like that is what
                        might be needed right now. A phalanx of heads and horns.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="story-block">
                    <p>So let's build our herd! We believe that by sharing your story with other women, by being
                        vulnerable and sharing your mistakes as well as your triumphs, you
                            will inspire others to get out there and give it a go. You will make this world
                        stronger, and safer, and frankly more delightful. Get ready to join the herd. Be HERD. You Are
                        Herd.</p>

                        <p>Amy and Gretchen met working as summer staff at YMCA Camp St. Croix in the late 1980s and
                            have been lifelong friends. At a time when big hair and even bigger glasses were in style
                            and girls were often taught that "no" meant "yes," they found camp to be a refuge. It was a
                            place where young women could create their own path, rather than conform to societal
                            expectations. They were free to be themselves— loud, funny, strong, brash, and daring. They
                            led rowdy songs in the dining hall, made no apologies for winning a challenge, pushed their
                            cabin groups to set high goals and expectations for themselves, and regularly challenged the
                            notion of a "four-man tent." It just felt fun at the time, but it turns out they were also
                            mentoring and empowering scores of girls; encouraging them to embrace their authentic
                            selves.</p>
                        <p>As Gretchen and Amy entered their fifties, they got the itch. What if there was a way to
                            continue to help women find their voice? Was it time to take a role as an elder and bring
                            the herd together for safety, strength, and community? We think so! Let's do this.</p>
